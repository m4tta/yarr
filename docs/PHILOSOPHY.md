# Philosophy

`yarr` exists to make new MCP servers safe, boring, and easy for agents to operate.

## Boring by design

- One binary.
- One HTTP port.
- One action-dispatch MCP tool.
- Clear layering between client, service, and transport shims.
- Repeatable scripts and release gates.

New servers from this template should be easy to understand, audit, and extend — not clever.

## Thin shims, rich service layer

MCP, REST, and CLI code should parse inputs and delegate. Validation, transformation, and business decisions belong in `YarrService`:

```
MCP shim   → parse JSON args     → service.method()  → return Value
CLI shim   → parse argv          → service.method()  → format/print
REST shim  → parse HTTP body     → service.method()  → return JSON
```

Zero business logic in shims. If you're writing validation in `mcp/tools.rs`, move it to `app.rs`.

## Secure defaults

- `.env` is ignored and blocked from commits by `scripts/block-env-commits.sh`.
- Non-loopback HTTP requires auth unless explicitly behind a trusted gateway (`YARR_NOAUTH=true`).
- Secrets in plugin settings must be marked `sensitive: true`.
- Plugin manifests do not carry version fields — marketplace versioning comes from git SHA/tags.
- Never hard-code tokens in unit files or documentation.

## Agent-first outputs

Agents have finite context windows. All outputs must be:

- **Bounded** — 10K token cap, truncation with a clear message
- **Structured** — stable JSON shapes that don't change between versions
- **Paginated** — every list action supports `limit` and `offset`
- **Self-describing** — `action="help"` always available, no auth required

Error messages must be correctable: state what failed, the bad value, why it failed, and the next command to run.

## Tests prove meaning

A good test proves the returned data is correct. Yarr tests:
- `codemode.search` must surface the expected per-service callables for configured services.
- `service_status` must return real upstream status fields for configured services.
- `api_get` must return the upstream response for a safe relative path.
- Resource tests must inspect schema content, not just check that `resources/read` returned HTTP 200.

A test that only checks `is_error: false` proves nothing about the service.

## Glass house, not black box

Every server must expose its internal state:
- `/health` — fast liveness, always public
- `/status` — redacted runtime state, always public
- `action="service_status"` (and `codemode.search`/`describe` for discovery) — MCP-native surfaces for clients that can't call HTTP directly
- Structured tracing on every upstream call
- Atomic counters for requests, errors, upstream calls

Operators and agents should never have to guess what the server is doing.

## Surface parity

Every business action reachable from MCP must also be reachable from the CLI. The service layer is called identically from both surfaces — no logic is duplicated, no behavior diverges. Because both shims call the same `YarrService` methods, parity is automatic when the shims are complete.

Allowed exceptions — documented in the parity table in `CLAUDE.md`:
- MCP-only protocol interactions (resources and prompts) have no CLI equivalent by design.
- CLI-only operational commands (`serve`, `mcp`, `doctor`, `watch`, `setup`) are infrastructure, not business actions.

REST API and Web UI are required only for application/platform servers that own meaningful state or non-MCP consumers. A thin upstream-client MCP server does not need a local REST API.

## Thin shim rule — absolute

The prohibition on business logic in shims is the hardest rule to enforce and the most commonly violated:

| Layer | Allowed | Prohibited |
|---|---|---|
| `<service>.rs` | HTTP requests, response parsing | Defaults, validation, error messages |
| `app.rs` | Everything | Nothing |
| `mcp/tools.rs` | Parse args, call service, return Value | Any conditional logic, defaults |
| `cli.rs` | Parse flags, call service, format output | Any conditional logic, defaults |
| `main.rs` | Config loading, mode dispatch | Any domain logic |

Signs of a violation: an `if` in `tools.rs` that isn't arg parsing; a default value set in `cli.rs`; a domain error message in `tools.rs`; any `match` in `cli.rs` beyond `cmd → service.method()`.

## Graceful degradation

The MCP server must stay running and return useful responses even when the upstream service is unavailable. Never crash on upstream failures.

1. **MCP server UP, upstream DOWN** — return `CallToolResult::error()`, not panics
2. **Partial failures** — return what succeeded, mark what failed
3. **Startup with bad config** — warn, don't crash (except security violations)
4. **Upstream timeouts** — fail fast with a clear error, suggest `action=service_status`

MCP tool errors must use `CallToolResult::error()`, not `Err(ErrorData)`. An `Err` crashes the tool call at the protocol level; a `CallToolResult::error` gives the agent a readable, actionable message.

## Mutating and Destructive Action Protection

Every CLI and MCP action runs immediately after authentication, scope checks,
and input validation. There is no confirm parameter, `--confirm` flag, or MCP
confirmation prompt. Clients and agents treat explicit user instructions as
authorization and clarify ambiguous requests before dispatch. The invariant the
registry enforces is `destructive => mutates` (every destructive action is a
write, but most writes are not destructive).

"Destructive" is narrower than "mutating": it means permanent loss of data that cannot be quickly and easily regenerated or recreated with minimal effort. Formatting a drive, deleting a code folder without recovery, or hard-resetting a repo past easy restore is destructive. Removing re-downloadable media, stopping containers, clearing OAuth tokens, toggling a gateway, or killing restartable processes is mutating but not destructive.

Actions such as `api_delete`, a generated DELETE `op`, `download_remove`, and
`stats_delete_image_cache` retain destructive metadata for planning, logging,
and review. The metadata does not gate execution.

## Plugin setup is data-only

Plugin hooks persist only allowlisted string values to a mode-0600 JSON file in
a mode-0700 per-service directory. Clients parse JSON without `source` or
`eval`. MCP launch is a repository-version-pinned npm stdio command, so plugins
do not bundle an ELF or manage a binary symlink during SessionStart.

## Three-tier skill fallback

Every server's Claude Code skill covers three fallback tiers in order:

1. **MCP tool** — preferred; full schema, scope enforcement, structured errors
2. **CLI binary** — when MCP is unavailable but the binary is installed
3. **Direct API** — last resort; `curl` with the upstream credentials

This ensures an agent can always reach the service regardless of which tooling is configured.

## Fail fast, validate early

Run pre-flight validation before binding the TCP listener. The `doctor` command reports every missing credential, unreachable upstream, and misconfigured path — with a one-line hint for each — before the user tries to start the server. Exit code 1 means not ready; exit code 0 means go.

Never silently start in a degraded state when a required credential is missing. Warn loudly or refuse to start.

## Small focused modules

Files should be easy to read in one sitting. When a file approaches 400 lines, split it. When a function approaches 100 lines, extract. One responsibility per file; no catch-all `utils.rs` or `helpers.rs`. `mod.rs` files are banned — use named module files.

See `docs/PATTERNS.md` for the full catalog of patterns and their implementation details.
