# Testing

## Local quality gates

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --profile ci
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps
cargo xtask patterns
cargo xtask check-test-siblings
cargo xtask tool-docs --check
python3 scripts/check-schema-docs.py --check
```

`cargo test` is a supported fallback when nextest is unavailable. CI also runs
Taplo, cargo-deny, gitleaks, npm package checks, actionlint, plugin/layout
contracts, blob/coupled-file checks, and the MSRV workflow.

## Test layout

Private unit tests use sibling modules: `src/foo.rs` declares
`#[path = "foo_tests.rs"] mod tests;`, and `src/foo_tests.rs` contains the
tests. The sibling checker enforces this for hand-written source.

Repository integration tests currently are:

| File | Contract |
|---|---|
| `tests/cli_parse.rs` | CLI parsing and command shapes |
| `tests/tool_dispatch.rs` | Action dispatch and service behavior |
| `tests/parity.rs` | Registered CLI/MCP action parity |
| `tests/plugin_contract.rs` | Plugin/package contract |
| `tests/template_invariants.rs` | Repository invariants |
| `tests/live/service_matrix.json` | Live service inventory data |
| `tests/mcporter/test-mcp.sh` | Thin wrapper around the live mcporter suite |

There is no `tests/e2e_tests.rs`, `tests/live_tests.rs`, or generated
`docs/contracts/` fixture tree. Live harness source lives under `xtask/src/live/`
with sibling tests in `xtask/src/live_tests.rs` and selected live submodules.

## Live backuphost harness

Live testing is opt-in and guarded to the disposable backuphost stack. The canonical
entry point is:

```bash
cargo xtask live --suite guard
cargo xtask live --suite all
```

Supported slices are:

```text
guard, cli, rest, mcp, mcporter, services, contract, lifecycles,
all, coverage-check, coverage-write
```

Examples:

```bash
cargo xtask live --suite cli
cargo xtask live --suite mcp
cargo xtask live --suite mcporter
cargo xtask live --suite contract
cargo xtask live --suite lifecycles
cargo xtask live --suite coverage-check
```

There is no `cargo xtask live-contracts` command. The generated-operation slice
is `cargo xtask live --suite contract`; the MCP callable slice is
`cargo xtask live --suite mcporter`.

The guard requires `YARR_HOME=/home/jmagar/.yarr-backuphost`, all 11 service kinds,
and upstream hosts on the disposable backuphost target. Unless `YARR_BIN` is set,
the harness builds and runs `target/debug/yarr` from the current checkout.

The `contract` suite verifies the generated executor's supported transport
behavior. Generator tests separately prove that unsupported operations are
excluded with explicit reasons in the runtime-derived capability matrix. See
`docs/API.md` for the support boundary.

## Destructive-test policy

Production MCP calls execute immediately after authentication, scope checks,
and input validation, including destructive calls. Live lifecycle tests operate
only on the disposable guarded stack and require explicit suite-level operator
opt-in plus their own reset/cleanup contract. Use `--no-destructive` when a suite
supports skipping mutation. Never point the live harness at production service
URLs or the normal `~/.yarr` data directory.

## Assertions

Assert semantic payloads, exact failure classes, or observable before/after
state. A 2xx response alone is not sufficient evidence that an upstream action
worked. Keep regression tests in the smallest layer that proves the behavior,
and add a live case only when the bug depends on a real upstream contract.
