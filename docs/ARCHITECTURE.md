# Architecture

`yarr` is one Rust binary with a service-grouped CLI, stdio MCP transport, and
Streamable HTTP MCP transport. It does not expose a local REST action API or an
embedded web UI.

## Request flow

```text
CLI parser or MCP handler
        -> action registry and dispatcher
        -> YarrService business layer
        -> YarrClient transport and per-service authentication
        -> configured upstream service
```

Transport shims parse and format. Validation, orchestration, path allowlists,
and upstream-specific behavior belong in `src/app*`, `src/actions*`, and
`src/yarr*`.

## Current module map

| Surface | Files | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Configuration | `src/config.rs`, `src/config/{auth,mcp,services}.rs` | TOML/env loading, defaults, service inventory, auth settings |
| Service topology | `src/capability.rs` | 11 `ServiceKind` descriptors, auth styles, prefixes, allowlists, capabilities |
| Action contract | `src/actions.rs`, `src/actions/{registry,model,parse,dispatch,help}.rs` | Generic and curated action metadata, parsing, dispatch |
| Business logic | `src/app.rs`, `src/app/{openapi_ops,download,stats,subtitles,trace,codemode}.rs` | Operation execution and curated behavior |
| Upstream transport | `src/yarr.rs`, `src/yarr/{auth,helpers}.rs` | HTTP, credentials, qBittorrent sessions, URL/response handling |
| CLI | `src/cli.rs`, `src/cli/` | Service-grouped commands plus doctor, setup, watch, snippets, Code Mode |
| MCP | `src/mcp.rs`, `src/mcp/` | Tool schemas, scopes, prompts/resources, transports |
| HTTP host | `src/server.rs`, `src/server/routes.rs` | Auth policy, routing, probes, metrics, CORS/body limits |
| Code Mode | `src/codemode.rs`, `src/codemode/` | QuickJS sandbox, catalog, proxies, snippets, artifacts, truncation |
| OpenAPI metadata | `src/openapi.rs`, `src/openapi/generated/` | Generated operation/type tables and lookup |
| Models/logging | `src/models.rs`, `src/models/`, `src/logging.rs`, `src/logging/` | Curated typed responses and dual-output logging |

Every hand-written source module has a sibling `_tests.rs` file. Generated
OpenAPI tables are exempt and are checked by generator drift tests.

## Services and capabilities

The supported kinds are Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Overseerr, SABnzbd,
qBittorrent, Plex, Jellyfin, Tautulli, Bazarr, and Tracearr. Capability classes
are `ArrManager`, `Indexer`, `DownloadClient`, `MediaServer`, `Requests`,
`Stats`, `Subtitles`, `Trace`, and `GenericOnly`.

Six kinds use vendored OpenAPI metadata tables: Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr,
Overseerr, Plex, and Jellyfin. The tables contain operation metadata and
TypeScript discovery types; execution remains one generic function in
`src/app/openapi_ops.rs`. See `docs/API.md` for the fidelity boundary.

SABnzbd/qBittorrent, Tautulli, Bazarr, and Tracearr have curated command groups
in addition to the generic passthrough surface. `src/actions/registry.rs` and
`src/actions/commands/*.rs` are the executable action source of truth.

## Server surfaces

```text
40070/tcp
  POST /mcp       authenticated Streamable HTTP MCP
  GET  /health    public liveness
  GET  /ready     public local configuration readiness
  GET  /status    public redacted runtime identity
  GET  /metrics   public Prometheus exposition
  /mcp/.well-known/* and OAuth routes when OAuth is mounted
```

The auth layer wraps `/mcp`; public probes are deliberately separate. Protect
probe/metrics reachability at the network or proxy boundary where required.

## Auth and destructive actions

`AuthPolicy` distinguishes loopback development, an explicitly trusted gateway,
and mounted bearer/OAuth auth. Static HTTP bearer tokens receive the configured
`YARR_MCP_STATIC_TOKEN_SCOPES` and default to read-only; bearer-only Code Mode
requires an explicit `yarr:write` grant. OAuth tokens carry issued scopes. Stdio
is a local trusted transport.

After transport authentication, scope checks, and input validation, MCP and CLI
actions execute immediately, including destructive actions and calls nested in
Code Mode. Destructive and disruptive classifications remain informative
metadata for clients and operators; they do not gate dispatch.

## Invariants

- Keep business behavior out of CLI/MCP formatting shims.
- Update action metadata and parsers together; run `cargo xtask tool-docs --check`.
- Keep service topology in `src/capability.rs`.
- Never hand-edit generated OpenAPI modules.
- Preserve the sibling-test convention and run `cargo xtask check-test-siblings`.
- Treat historical session/plan documents as evidence, not current authority.
