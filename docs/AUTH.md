# Authentication

This server supports two authentication mechanisms simultaneously: **static bearer tokens** and **OAuth 2.0**. They serve different audiences and can be active at the same time.

---

## Why two mechanisms?

**Bearer tokens** are for agents and automation. An agent sets `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and makes calls. No browser, no redirect flow, no session cookie — just a shared secret. Tokens are fast to issue (`just gen-token`) and easy to rotate.

**OAuth** is for humans. It runs a full browser-based Google OAuth flow, issues short-lived JWTs, and maintains refresh tokens. This is the right choice when a human user needs to grant access through a UI without ever seeing a raw token.

When both are configured, each request is accepted if it satisfies either mechanism. A human signs in via OAuth; an agent uses a token. They share the same server.

---

## Scopes

All non-trivial actions require at least `yarr:read`. Mutating actions require `yarr:write`, which also satisfies read checks. The `help` action is always public.

Static bearer tokens default to `yarr:read`. Set `YARR_MCP_STATIC_TOKEN_SCOPES=yarr:write` (or `yarr:read,yarr:write`) only when that shared token must call write-scoped operations or Code Mode. OAuth tokens carry the scopes issued by the OAuth flow.

---

## Configuring bearer token auth

```bash
# Generate a token
export YARR_MCP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Or: just gen-token
```

Set `YARR_MCP_TOKEN` in your environment or `.env` file. An explicit token is enforced on both loopback and non-loopback HTTP binds. Clients authenticate with:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The safe default is read-only:

```bash
YARR_MCP_STATIC_TOKEN_SCOPES=yarr:read
YARR_MCP_TOOL_MODE=flat
```

To use the default single-tool Code Mode surface with a static token, grant write explicitly:

```bash
YARR_MCP_STATIC_TOKEN_SCOPES=yarr:write
YARR_MCP_TOOL_MODE=codemode
```

Bearer-only startup fails instead of advertising an unusable Code Mode tool when the token lacks `yarr:write`.

---

## Configuring OAuth

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
YARR_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth
YARR_MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-server.yarr.com   # public URL for OAuth callbacks
YARR_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
YARR_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
YARR_MCP_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@yarr.com
```

The server exposes standard OAuth discovery endpoints under `/mcp/.well-known/` that MCP clients can use for dynamic registration. Session cookies are disabled — all auth is via `Authorization` headers.

OAuth and bearer token can coexist: set both `YARR_MCP_TOKEN` and the OAuth variables. To disable bearer tokens while OAuth is active, set `disable_static_token_with_oauth = true` under `[mcp.auth]` in `config.toml` (this is a config file field, not an environment variable).

OAuth `public_url` must be an HTTPS origin with no credentials, query, or
fragment. Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback development URLs. Unknown
keys under `[mcp.auth]` are rejected so a misspelled security setting cannot be
silently ignored.

OAuth `POST /token` is capped process-wide at 30 attempts per rolling minute.
Excess attempts return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After: 60` and increment
`yarr_auth_token_issuance_total{outcome="rate_limited"}`. This in-process cap
is aggregate, resets on restart, and cannot identify a client behind a shared
address. Production reverse proxies must also enforce a per-client `/token`
rate limit before requests reach Yarr.

The RSA implementation used transitively by `lab-auth` is temporarily covered
by the reviewed `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` exception in `deny.toml`. That exception
expires on 2026-10-01 and CI fails closed on or after the deadline. HTTPS,
mode-restricted signing-key storage, validated OAuth grants, short-lived tokens,
the process-wide signing cap, its metric/alert, and reverse-proxy per-client
limits reduce exposure while `lab-auth` is migrated to Ed25519; they do not
make the timing advisory disappear.

Local OAuth state is single-replica. Before initializing OAuth, Yarr acquires
an exclusive `${sqlite_path}.instance.lock` next to the configured auth SQLite
database and holds it for the process lifetime. A second replica using that
database fails startup with an instruction to run exactly one replica or
disable local OAuth. NFS/network-shared SQLite and lock files are unsupported;
do not use them as a scaling mechanism. Multiple OAuth replicas require a
future shared auth/state backend.

## The startup guard

**The HTTP server will refuse to start if it is binding to a non-loopback address with no authentication configured.**

This is enforced by `server::resolve_auth_policy_kind()`. The exact error:

```
Refusing to bind MCP server to 0.0.0.0 without authentication.

Choose one of:
1. Bind to loopback:    YARR_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
2. Set a bearer token:  YARR_MCP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
3. Enable OAuth:        YARR_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth (+ OAuth credentials)
4. Disable auth:        YARR_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 YARR_MCP_NO_AUTH=true
5. Upstream gateway:    YARR_NOAUTH=true  (if a proxy handles auth)
```

The guard passes when any of the following is true:

| Condition | Variable | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Loopback bind without explicit auth | `YARR_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1` | Trust boundary is the network address |
| Bearer token set | `YARR_MCP_TOKEN=<token>` | Auth middleware enforces it on any HTTP bind |
| OAuth enabled | `YARR_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth` | Auth middleware enforces it on any HTTP bind |
| Auth disabled | `YARR_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1` + `YARR_MCP_NO_AUTH=true` | Local dev — see below |
| Gateway override | `YARR_NOAUTH=true` | Upstream handles auth — see below |

---

## Local development (no auth)

For local development, disable auth entirely:

```bash
just dev
# equivalent to: YARR_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 YARR_MCP_NO_AUTH=true cargo run -- serve mcp
```

`YARR_MCP_NO_AUTH=true` is accepted only on a loopback bind. It sets the auth policy to `LoopbackDev`, removes the auth middleware, and requires no token for local calls.

**Do not use this in production.**

---

## Upstream gateway / MCP proxy (no server-level auth)

If you deploy behind a gateway that handles authentication for all services (e.g. an MCP proxy that validates tokens before routing to this server), you can disable auth at the server level:

```bash
YARR_NOAUTH=true         # acknowledge the startup guard that an upstream gateway handles auth
```

`YARR_NOAUTH=true` selects the explicit `TrustedGatewayUnscoped` policy. It removes the local auth middleware and scope checks, so only use it when a trusted upstream gateway enforces both authentication and authorization before traffic reaches this server.

---

## Stdio transport

The stdio transport (`yarr mcp`) bypasses all HTTP auth entirely. It is always `LoopbackDev` — the trust boundary is the OS pipe between parent and child process. Scope checks are not enforced in stdio mode. This matches the MCP spec: stdio servers are local, trusted, subprocess connections.

---

## Auth policy reference

The `AuthPolicy` enum in `src/server.rs` controls what the router does:

| Policy | When | Auth enforced? | Scope checks? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LoopbackDev` | Loopback bind with no explicit bearer/OAuth auth, or stdio mode. `YARR_MCP_NO_AUTH=true` also selects it for loopback development. | No | No |
| `TrustedGatewayUnscoped` | Non-loopback no-auth deployment with `YARR_NOAUTH=true` | No | No |
| `Mounted { auth_state: None }` | Bearer-only mode on any HTTP bind | Yes (token) | Yes |
| `Mounted { auth_state: Some(_) }` | OAuth mode on any HTTP bind (+ optional token) | Yes (OAuth / token) | Yes |

Public endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`, `/status`, `/metrics`) are never gated by
auth, regardless of policy. `/ready` exposes only the configured-service count,
`/status` returns redacted local metadata, and `/metrics` must be protected at
the network or reverse-proxy layer if it is not intended for public scraping.

Static bearer tokens receive the scopes in `YARR_MCP_STATIC_TOKEN_SCOPES`; the
default remains `yarr:read`. `yarr:write` must be granted explicitly. Once
transport authentication, scope checks, and input validation succeed, actions
execute immediately, including destructive actions and calls nested in Code
Mode. Clients are responsible for resolving user intent before dispatch.

## TEMPLATE

When you adapt this template, replace all `YARR_` prefixes with your service's prefix throughout `src/config.rs`, `src/main.rs`, and this document.
