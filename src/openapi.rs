//! Generated OpenAPI operation surface (runtime side).
//!
//! For the spec-backed services (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Overseerr, Jellyfin,
//! Plex, and qBittorrent) the supported upstream operations and component types are
//! **generated from the vendored OpenAPI specs** under `specs/` by
//! `cargo xtask gen-openapi`, not hand-written. This module holds the runtime
//! shapes the generated tables fill in ([`OperationSpec`], [`TypeDef`]), the
//! per-kind registry, and the generic executor that turns one
//! `(service, op, args)` call into an upstream request.
//!
//! Discovery (`codemode.search`/`describe`) and the per-service callable namespace
//! are driven entirely off these tables, so adding/refreshing a service is a
//! regeneration step. qBittorrent uses a locally maintained, source-audited spec
//! and also retains its curated convenience commands and response models.
