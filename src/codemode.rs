//! Code Mode — run a JavaScript async arrow function that calls yarr actions.
//!
//! This is a port of lab's "Code Mode" concept (gateway `codemode` tool) adapted
//! to yarr's single-binary, action-dispatched model:
//!
//!   * **Catalog.** Lab exposes upstream MCP servers; yarr exposes its *action
//!     registry*. The in-sandbox `callTool(action, params)`, the per-service
//!     `<service>.<verb>(params)` callables, and the raw `api.<service>` client all
//!     dispatch through the same shared
//!     [`crate::actions::execute_service_action`] path the CLI and MCP shims use.
//!   * **Engine.** Lab runs QuickJS-via-`javy` inside a `wasmtime` subprocess.
//!     yarr embeds QuickJS in-process via [`rquickjs`] — same engine semantics,
//!     no subprocess/wasm runtime, which fits a single binary. The engine runs on
//!     a blocking thread; `callTool` is a *synchronous* native function that blocks
//!     on a channel round-trip to the async dispatcher (see [`crate::app`]), so the
//!     JS `async`/`await` sugar is driven purely by the microtask pump — no async
//!     JS runtime is needed.
//!   * **Safety.** Memory and stack are capped, and a wall-clock deadline aborts
//!     runaway scripts via a QuickJS interrupt handler. MCP requests reauthorize
//!     every inner action before immediate dispatch.
//!
//! Module layout:
//!   [`engine`] — the rquickjs execution harness (pure; takes an opaque tool
//!     caller). [`proxy`] — generates the JS preamble (`callTool`, `console`, the
//!     per-service `<service>.<verb>()` callables, and the `api.<service>` client)
//!     from the configured services.
