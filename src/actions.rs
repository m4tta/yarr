//! Action layer facade.
//!
//! The action surface is split into submodules to keep every file <500 LOC and
//! to make the curated-command registry data-driven (so each capability bead
//! appends a const slice rather than editing a giant enum):
//!
//!   - [`model`]    — `YarrAction`, `ActionSpec`, `ValidationError`, scopes
//!   - [`effects`]  — shared operation-effect classification for MCP policy
//!   - [`registry`] — `ACTION_SPECS`, name/scope lookups, the `CommandDescriptor`
//!     table, and `action_allowed_for_kind` validation
//!   - [`parse`]    — shared param extractors + `YarrAction` construction
//!   - [`dispatch`] — `execute_service_action`
//!   - [`help`]     — `rest_help`
//!
//! All previously top-level items are re-exported here so `crate::actions::*`
//! imports across `cli.rs` and `mcp/*` resolve unchanged.
