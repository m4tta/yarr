//! Dispatch: map a parsed `YarrAction` to the corresponding service method.
//!
//! This is the SHARED dispatch path for BOTH the CLI and MCP shims, so the
//! action×kind validation guard lives here (LD4 / architecture F4-a) rather than
//! in `mcp/rmcp_server.rs` — the CLI never touches that file. Every action that
//! targets a service is checked against the resolved [`ServiceKind`](crate::config::ServiceKind) before it
//! runs, so a curated command can never reach an incompatible kind regardless of
//! which transport invoked it.
