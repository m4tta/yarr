//! Help payload generation for the `help` action.
//!
//! Two shapes share this module:
//!   * [`rest_help`] — structured JSON used by the CLI `help` command.
//!   * [`help_text`] — generated Markdown used by the MCP `help` action.
//!
//! The Markdown is GENERATED from the action registry + capability map (rather
//! than a static const that drifts) so curated commands appear automatically and
//! a compact capability digest (AN-1/AN-3) aids first-try action selection.
